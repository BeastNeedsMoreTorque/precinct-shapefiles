From Michael Howser at UCONN Michael.Howser@lib.uconn.edu. This is the 2012 file from TIGER. He noted:

Matthew,

Based on reviewing what shapefile options were available for a statewide voting district file, it appears the 2012 Voting Districts file available from the U.S. Census Bureau Tiger line files is the latest data we have been able to locate thus far and we are still contacting a few other sources to see if a more recent version is available. If we locate anything newer we will email it you ASAP.


Cheers,


michael
