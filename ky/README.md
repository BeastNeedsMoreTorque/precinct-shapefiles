I have a written request in with Greg Woosley of Kentucky's [Legislative Research Commission](http://lrc.ky.gov/). Kentucky did not participate in [census's 2010 distribution of precinct shapes](http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2010/VTD/2010/), nor does there appear to be a Kentucky file in the [Harvard project](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/eda/data). Woosley confirmed to me that LRC has a statewide shapefile (from 2011), though updates have occurred since that time; this file is made public only on a case-by-case basis.
